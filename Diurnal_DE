#Diurnal Differential Expression Plan - for more detail see 2023-08-14 section in circadian_rhythm_Aging google doc
#"metadata_aging_TOD_DayNight.csv" = metadata file containing time of death (TOD) and Day/Night information 
#Day/Night Values = 0 - NA, No TOD provided    1 - Day - TOD ZT 0-12    2 - Night - TOD ZT 12-18; -6 - 0    

#Throughout use full combined cohort (MSSM+HBCC) 
#Also previously discussed doing in: 
#  (A) both with and w/out duplicate datasets and 
#  (B) in datasets where age is or is not controlled for


#Section 1: Day x Night DE in (1) cell types (2) subclass and (3) subtypes 
#In this section - can also compare doing in datasets where sex is or is not controlled for 

#1.1 DxN of Individual Groups 
#Group 4_Early Adulthood(21-40):   Day - n = 18    Night - n = 23
#Group 5_Late Adulthood(41-60):    Day - n = 47    Night - n = 16
#Group 6_Old Age (>60):            Day - n = 51    Night - n = 25

#1.2 DxN of Combined Groups 
#Group 4-5_Adulthood(21-60):       Day - n = 65    Night - n = 39
#Group 4-6_Adulthood+Old Age(>20)  Day - n = 116   Night - n = 66



#Section 2: Sex Differences in Diurnal DE in (1) cell types (2) subclass and (3) subtypes 
#Can we do factorial ANOVA-type comparisons in dreamlet? - will effect if we run as a single model or in 4 separate DE comparisons 

#Group 4-5 Adulthood
#    Female:   Day - n = 14    Night - n = 12
#    Male:     Day - n = 51    Night - n = 27
#Group 6 Old Age
#    Female:   Day - n = 22    Night - n = 11
#    Male:     Day - n = 29    Night - n = 15
Group 4-6 Adulthood + Old Age 
#    Female:   Day - n = 36    Night - n = 23
#    Male:     Day - n = 70    Night - n = 42
